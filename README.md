# **PCB_Tools**  

## **Description**  

Welcome to the **PCB_Tools** repository! This project provides a collection of tools and resources for designing and manufacturing printed circuit boards (PCBs). Here, you'll find schematic libraries, PCB footprints, and a set of manufacturing rules tailored for specific industry standards.  

## **Contents**  

- **Schematic Library** â€“ Collection of component schematics.  
- **PCB Library** â€“ Footprints and layout references.  
- **Manufacturing Rules** â€“ Design constraints and specifications for PCB fabrication.  

## **Naming Convention**  

To ensure consistency and clarity, the libraries follow a structured naming convention for both schematics and PCB footprints.  

### **Schematic Naming:**  

```
(THT/SMD) component_name (details)
```

- **THT/SMD** â†’ Specifies whether the component is Through-Hole (THT) or Surface-Mount Device (SMD).  
- **component_name** â†’ Component type (e.g., resistor, capacitor, IC, etc.).  
- **(details)** â†’ Additional specifications.  

**Examples:**  
- `THT Resistor 10kÎ©`  
- `SMD ESP32-S3 IC`  

### **PCB Footprint Naming:**  

```
(THT/SMD) component_name (package/specifications)
```

- **THT/SMD** â†’ Defines the mounting technology.  
- **component_name** â†’ Identifies the component.  
- **(package/specifications)** â†’ Specifies the package type.  

**Examples:**  
- `SMD Capacitor 0603`  
- `SMD ATmega328P TQFP-32`
